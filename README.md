# Artisyn.io

## Find Artisans Near You

Artisyn is a decentralized protocol on Starknet connecting local artisans with users through community-curated listings. Curators add and verify skilled workers, while finders discover them trustlessly. Built with zk-rollups for low-cost transparency, Artisyn empowers underserved economies by replacing centralized platforms with a censorship-resistant, open-source directory.
